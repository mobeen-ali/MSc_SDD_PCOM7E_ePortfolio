## üìò Overview

This GitHub repository contains the full e-Portfolio submission for the MSc Secure Software Development module.  
It is organized unit-by-unit and demonstrates:

- My understanding of secure software principles
- Application of tools, techniques, and methodologies across the SDLC
- Evidence of my individual development process and critical reflection
- Full artefact history including design documents, CLI project code, testing, and discussion contributions

## üìå Reflection

The reflection document is written in a diary-style tone and follows the Rolfe et al. (2001) model:
- **What?** ‚Äì What I did and learned
- **So What?** ‚Äì Why it mattered to me
- **Now What?** ‚Äì How I‚Äôll apply this in the future

It captures both technical growth and emotional experience across the module.

## üß© Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì Secure CLI development
- **Click**, **bcrypt**, **PyOTP**, **cryptography**, **pytest**
- **flake8**, **bandit** ‚Äì For code quality and security linting
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì Version control and evidence of solo development
- **Markdown** ‚Äì For structured, clean documentation

---

## üîê Learning Outcomes Addressed

1. Identify and manage security risks in software projects  
2. Analyse development problems and apply suitable tools/methods  
3. Design, implement, and evaluate secure software solutions  
4. Work effectively as a development team member (virtually)
