# 🔐 MSc Secure Software Development – E-Portfolio  
**Student:** Mobeen Ali  
**Module Code:** PCOM7E  
**Course:** MSc Computer Science (University of Essex Online)  
**Assessment:** Secure Software Development E-Portfolio Submission

---

## 📘 Overview

This e-Portfolio documents my development and reflection throughout the Secure Software Development module. It combines theoretical concepts with practical Python-based software engineering to demonstrate secure design, testing, and implementation.

The culmination of this work is a secure Command-Line Interface (CLI) e-commerce system with encryption, authentication, role-based access, and logging — supported by progressive unit artefacts and reflections.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

- **Python 3.11**
- `Click` – CLI framework  
- `bcrypt`, `Fernet`, `PyOTP` – secure password hashing, encryption, and 2FA  
- `Flask` & `Flask-RESTful` – REST API for distributed environments  
- `pytest`, `flake8`, `pylint` – testing, linting, and code validation

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Secure software design from architecture to implementation
- OWASP Top 10 risk mitigation
- GDPR-aligned data handling and encryption
- Role-based access control and secure CLI interaction
- Static and dynamic code testing practices
- Group-based secure design followed by individual implementation

## 🚀 How to Explore

To run the final CLI project:
1. Navigate to: `Unit_11/ecommerce_cli_SSD_Project`
2. Follow `README.md` inside the folder for setup instructions
3. Review the modular codebase and security layers applied
