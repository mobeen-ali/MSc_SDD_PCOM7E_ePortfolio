# Unit 9 Summary – Developing an API for a Distributed Environment

In Unit 9, the focus was on refining and securing the Flask-based Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) first introduced in Unit 7, aligning it with principles required for robust distributed environments.

## Key Enhancements in `distributed_environment_api_v2.py`

- **Input Validation**  
  Used `reqparse` to enforce strict type and presence checks, preventing malformed or unsafe data submissions.

- **Case-Insensitive Handling**  
  Ensured all user name comparisons are case-insensitive, increasing flexibility and reducing errors.

- **Structured JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Responses**  
  Standardised response formatting across all endpoints, improving consistency and simplifying client integration.

- **Accurate Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Status Codes**  
  Implemented semantically appropriate status codes (200, 201, 400, 404), aligning with RESTful standards.

## Outcome

These enhancements strengthened the API’s **reliability, security, and maintainability**, providing a solid base for future expansion or deployment in a distributed setting. This exercise demonstrated the importance of precision, validation, and predictability in real-world API development.
