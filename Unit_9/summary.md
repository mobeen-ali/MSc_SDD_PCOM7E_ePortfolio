# ✅ Unit 9 Summary – Developing an API for a Distributed Environment

In this unit, I extended the Flask API developed in Unit 7 by improving input validation, consistency in response messages, and status codes.

Key updates in this version ([`distributed_environment_api_v2.py`](../Unit_9/distributed_environment_api_v2.py)) include:
- Added data type validation for inputs using `reqparse`
- Normalised name matching (case-insensitive)
- Ensured all endpoints return meaningful and consistent JSON responses
- Used standard HTTP status codes across all routes

These enhancements helped reinforce best practices for building clean, secure, and user-friendly APIs in a distributed Python environment.
