# Unit 3 Summary â€“ Programming Languages: History, Concepts, and Design

## ðŸ§  Key Learning

Unit 3 focused on the evolution of programming languages and how their core paradigms influence software quality and security. I gained insight into how language features such as **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, and **inheritance** especially in Python, support secure and modular development.

The unit also highlighted how poor design choices at the language or architectural level can result in insecure systems. Understanding **design patterns** and Pythonic practices helped me apply a security-first mindset during software design and implementation.

## ðŸ›  Artefact: Object-Oriented Authentication Example

To apply the principles discussed, I developed a Python-based authentication system that demonstrates:

- **Encapsulation**: Passwords are stored as hashed attributes.
- **Abstraction**: Internal hashing and verification logic is hidden.
- **Inheritance**: An `AdminUser` subclass extends the `User` class with additional features.
- **Security**: Uses `bcrypt` for secure password hashing, in line with best practices.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Secure Functionality

I implemented a dedicated test suite using `pytest` to verify the following:

- Password checking works for correct and incorrect input
- Admin user correctly inherits base functionality
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext
