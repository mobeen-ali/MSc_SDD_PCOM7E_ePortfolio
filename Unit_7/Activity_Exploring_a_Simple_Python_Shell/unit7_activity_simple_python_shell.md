# Secure Shell Analysis & Hardening Notes

This document evaluates the security of `unit7_activity_secure_shell.py` and outlines enhancements following best practices.

---

## Vulnerability Summary

### 1. **Lack of Command Throttling**
An infinite loop awaits user input with no delay or throttling. This can allow brute-force or input-flooding attacks (denial of service risk).

---

## Demonstration of Input Flooding

To simulate an input-flooding attack and demonstrate the lack of throttling:

### Prerequisites

Ensure `unit7_activity_secure_shell.py` and `input_flood_simulation.py` are in the same directory.

### Flood Script: `input_flood_simulation.py`

```python
import subprocess
import time

def run_flood():
    print("[INFO] Starting input flood on unit7_activity_secure_shell.py...")
    try:
        process = subprocess.Popen(
            ["python", "unit7_activity_secure_shell.py"],
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True
        )

        for i in range(500):
            process.stdin.write("HELP\n")
            process.stdin.flush()
            time.sleep(0.005)

        print("[INFO] Flood completed. Terminating shell...")
        time.sleep(1)
        process.terminate()

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[ERROR] Flooding failed: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_flood()
```

### Expected Outcome

- `secure_shell.log` will be filled with rapid `HELP` command logs.
- CPU usage may spike briefly.
- Shell becomes sluggish or non-responsive after heavy flooding.

## Recommended Improvements

### Command Logging (Already Implemented)
All user inputs are logged for traceability:
```python
logging.basicConfig(filename='secure_shell.log', level=logging.INFO)
```

### Optional Session Timeout (Pseudocode)
```python
import signal

def timeout_handler(signum, frame):
    print("\n[Session Timeout]")
    exit(1)

signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
signal.alarm(120)
```

### Authentication Layer (Pseudocode)
```python
def authenticate():
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    if password != os.getenv("SHELL_PASS"):
        print("Access denied.")
        sys.exit(1)
```

### Input Throttling
Introduce session limits or cooldown intervals to prevent abuse.

---

## Code Quality

- Verified via `flake8` (PEP8 compliant)
- Modular structure with clear error handling
- Defensive programming via try/except blocks

---

## Sample Test Output

```plaintext
>>> HELP
Available Commands:
  LIST   - List contents of the current directory
  ADD    - Add two numbers
  HELP   - Show this help message
  EXIT   - Exit the shell

>>> ADD
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add hashed login system for authorized shell access
- Encrypt log files
- Rate-limit command entries
- Convert to modular CLI using `click` package

---

## Conclusion

`unit7_activity_secure_shell.py` is a basic but secure CLI shell for educational use. With command logging and clean architecture already in place, it is suitable for learning environments. Adding input throttling and session controls would enhance its resistance to abuse.
