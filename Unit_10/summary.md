# âœ… Unit 10 Summary â€“ Testing, Faceted Data, and Secure Architecture Principles

## ðŸ“˜ Readings & Reflections

- I reflected on **Schmitz et al. (2016)** and proposed a simple faceted access model in Python to show how role-based data filtering helps reduce leakage.
- I also reviewed **Bogner et al. (2023)** and confirmed that my CLI system followed their principles such as modularity, secure defaults, and clean separation of logic.

ðŸ“„ Reflections saved as:
- `faceted_data_reflection.md`
- `bogner_design_rules.md` (updated with concise version)

## ðŸ§ª Testing (Covered Previously)

Testing for core features was already demonstrated in Unit 7 and Unit 8 using `pytest`. Unit 10 reinforced the importance of testable, modular architecture.
