# Unit 5 Summary ‚Äì Introduction to Testing for Secure Software

## üß† Key Learning

In Unit 5, I explored a range of software testing strategies relevant to secure development, including test planning, test automation with `pytest`, and logic complexity via **Cyclomatic Complexity**.

A key part of this unit was the application of **Equivalence Partitioning**, which helps reduce the number of test cases while maintaining meaningful coverage. I also analyzed how logic complexity correlates with security risks when input validation or control flow is not well structured.

## üõ† Artefacts

### üîπ `equivalence.py`

This script demonstrates equivalence partitioning on integers from `-3` to `4`, using the relation `(x - y) % 4 == 0`. It groups input values into **equivalence classes** such that all values in a group return `True` when compared pairwise using the defined relation.

#### ‚úÖ Observed Output:

{1, -3}
{2, -2}
{3, -1}
{0, 4}
1 : {1, -3}
2 : {2, -2}
3 : {3, -1}
0 : {0, 4}
4 : {0, 4}
-2 : {2, -2}
-3 : {1, -3}
-1 : {3, -1}

#### üì∑ Equivalence Partitioning Output

Below is the result of executing `equivalence.py`, confirming the function correctly grouped inputs using the relation `(x - y) % 4 == 0`:

#### üîç Interpretation:

- The function partitions data by **logical equivalence** instead of equality.
- Helps identify **redundant test inputs** by grouping values that behave identically under the system's logic.
- This principle is vital in security-focused systems where **edge case enumeration** must balance coverage and performance.

## üìä Cyclomatic Complexity

I manually evaluated the recursive function from Unit 4 and determined:
- Entry point: 1
- Decisions: 4
- Complexity Score ‚âà 5

This confirms that even small utility functions can have branching logic requiring dedicated test cases.

## ‚úÖ Reflection

This unit reinforced that **security testing is both structural and logical**. Cyclomatic complexity, equivalence partitioning, and traditional testing all provide different but necessary views into how software may fail or be exploited. I am now more intentional about how I write and test functions to avoid untestable logic and silent failures.
