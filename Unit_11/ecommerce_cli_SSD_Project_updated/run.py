Purpose:
--------
This is the entry point for the Secure CLI E-Commerce Application.

It initializes the Click-based CLI defined in `app/cli.py`, enabling
users to register, authenticate, and manage products securely via terminal commands.

Usage:
-------
$ python run.py [COMMANDS]

For available commands, run:
$ python run.py --help

Security Note:
--------------
Click is used to handle command-line parsing securely.
All interactions are routed through validated and structured commands,
reducing the risk of injection or malformed input attacks.
