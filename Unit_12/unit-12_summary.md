# âœ… Unit 12 Summary â€“ Reflective Practice

In this final unit, I reflected on my learning throughout the Secure Software Development module using the Rolfe et al. (2001) reflective model: **What? So What? Now What?**

The reflection captures how I engaged with secure design principles, modular coding practices, threat modelling, and practical Python implementation. It also discusses the evolution of my skills in authentication, encryption, logging, and test-driven development, all applied during the CLI e-commerce project.

Key insights included:
- The value of starting with a strong design foundation (Unit 6)
- The hands-on learning of encryption and API development (Units 7â€“9)
- The importance of structured testing and PEP8 compliance (Unit 11)

The complete reflective piece is provided as a separate document:

This marks the conclusion of the module and the e-Portfolio submission.
