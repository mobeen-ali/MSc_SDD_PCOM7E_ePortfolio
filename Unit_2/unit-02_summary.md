# Unit 2 Summary – UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning

## Key Learning

Secure software architecture must begin at the design phase. **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**, when applied strategically, functions as a mechanism for **threat anticipation**, not mere documentation. It facilitates early identification of vulnerabilities by visualising authentication flows, exception handling paths, and misuse scenarios. This unit emphasized the doctrine of **“secure by design”**, where design ambiguity is regarded as a systemic weakness.

The **Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is not inherently security-averse. When security is integrated into backlog grooming, sprint planning, and retrospectives, it becomes a continuous discipline—not an end-phase patchwork. As Olmsted (2020) notes, secure thinking must not be bolted on at the end, but embedded from the outset.

Flowcharts and sequence diagrams function as **risk-mapping instruments**. They enable early detection of architectural flaws, preventing latent vulnerabilities from surfacing in production environments.

## Activity Summary

- Re-engineered the Unit 1 flowchart to incorporate secure system planning principles, particularly addressing **error verbosity**, **directory exposure**, and insecure **default configurations**.
- Embedded security evaluation prompts into Agile ceremonies (e.g., “What attack surfaces were introduced this sprint?”).
- Traced design-stage oversights that commonly lead to configuration-based vulnerabilities and system compromise.
- Engaged in preparatory analysis for **secure architecture review workshops**, ensuring each design choice could be defended under scrutiny.
