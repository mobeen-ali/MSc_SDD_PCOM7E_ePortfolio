# Unit 2 Summary ‚Äì UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning

## üß† Key Learning

In Unit 2, we focused on how secure development practices can be introduced early in the SDLC using UML models. The emphasis was on the **Agile SDLC** and how it provides opportunities to **embed security throughout the lifecycle**, not just at the end.

The concept of **"secure by design"** stood out for me. I realized that modelling isn't just about documentation, it‚Äôs a form of security thinking. By visualizing flows and edge cases (e.g., error handling, authentication failures), we reduce ambiguity and plan for resilience.

UML diagrams like flowcharts and sequence diagrams were re-emphasized here as communication tools between developers and stakeholders, and also as mechanisms to **expose design flaws before coding begins**.

## üîç Activity Summary

- Revisited my **Unit 1 flowchart** on security misconfiguration and reviewed it through the lens of secure system planning.
- Studied how different Agile ceremonies (e.g., sprint planning, retrospectives) can include **security discussions**.
- Examined how system weaknesses like **directory listing, misconfigurations, or verbose errors** can often be traced to gaps in design-phase decisions.
- Prepared for seminar discussions related to **Scrum and secure architecture reviews**.

## üöß Notes

There were no peer responses on my Unit 1 post during this week. However, I reviewed other students' diagrams and reflected on how each of us approached modelling slightly differently, particularly in how we represented parallel attack paths.

This helped me appreciate that even within standard modelling tools like UML, **security understanding and creativity** still play a critical role.
